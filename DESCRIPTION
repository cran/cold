Description: Performs regression analysis for longitudinal count data,  
   allowing for serial dependence among observations from a given 
   individual and two dimensional random effects on the linear predictor. 
   Estimation is via maximization of the exact likelihood of a suitably 
   defined model. Missing values and unbalanced data are allowed.
